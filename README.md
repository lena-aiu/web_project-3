# Learning how to learn

*05/18/2020 is the recent updates to the codebase.*

#### Single-page website project 
-----
To code this project I used my skills in HTML and CSS languages, also my knowledge BEM technology.

Here you'll see how:
* arrange items using flexbox;
* position elements;
* to do animations and transformations with **CSS**;
* use **HTML** elements for embedding media items;
* to build a file structure according to the BEM methodology;
* learn to gain new knowledge using different ways.

Also, some component was modified and reused. The project structure is built in a convenient way.

My improving plan for this project is to add different fonts and to design a form to allow users to send a comment and check the code for cross-compatibility and adding all the necessary vendor prefixes.
