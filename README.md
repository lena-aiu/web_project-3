# From Portland to Portland

*07/20/2020 is the recent updates to the codebase.*

#### Single-page website project 
-----
To code this project I used my skills in HTML and CSS languages, also my knowledge BEM technology.

Here you'll see:
* Media queries;
* CSS Grid Layout;
* Differenr fonts;
* Responsive images;
* Css Pseudo elements;
* Cross Broser Compability;
* A file structure according to the BEM methodology.


My improving plan for this project is to design a form to allow users to send a comment and adding all the necessary vendor prefixes.
